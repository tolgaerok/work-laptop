# *`Pre-production release !!`*

I've curated a collection of essential packages that you can conveniently install on your NixOS system with a single command: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`. These carefully selected programs cover a wide range of categories, from archive utilities and multimedia tools to programming languages, office suites, and system utilities. By including these packages, I've aimed to enhance your NixOS experience and make your system feel more complete. Whether you're a developer, content creator, or everyday user, these additions offer a well-rounded toolkit that's ready for immediate use. Simply run the command, and enjoy the convenience and functionality that these packages bring to your NixOS environment.

## Syncing User Home Folder to a Specified Destination

One of the key scripts I've developed is a custom synchronization script. This script allows me to effortlessly sync my user home folder to a specified destination. By running this script, I can ensure that all my important files and configurations are backed up and accessible from any location. This is particularly helpful when I switch machines or need to restore my settings after a fresh installation.

## Assisting with Mounting, Unmounting, and Suspending

To streamline my workflow, I've also developed a set of personal scripts that assist me with mounting, unmounting, and suspending operations. These scripts automate common tasks, saving me time and effort in managing external drives or suspending my system when I step away. By executing these scripts, I can perform these operations with just a single command, making my workflow more efficient.

## Custom NixOS Configuration File with Bluetooth Variables

As an enthusiast of NixOS, a powerful Linux distribution with a declarative approach to system configuration, I've created a custom configuration file tailored to my needs. In this file, I've set specific variables related to Bluetooth devices. By configuring these variables, I can easily manage my Bluetooth devices and ensure a seamless experience.

## Calling Common NixOS Commands with a Custom Script

To further simplify my interactions with NixOS, I've developed a custom script that encapsulates the most frequently used commands. With this script, I can quickly execute common tasks such as updating the system, installing packages, or configuring services. This saves me the hassle of remembering or typing out lengthy commands each time I need to perform these operations.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„

## *`How to run?`*

1. Make sure `git` is usable. If not, *add it into your environment.systemPackages in configuration.nix:*
   - Execute `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` in your terminal afterward.

```sh
Terminal: nix-shell -p git
Terminal: nix-shell -p git-extras
Terminal: nix-shell -p gitFull

or add into your configuration.nix file

# Nix package collection (pkgs) that you want to include in the system environment.
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [    
    git
    git-extras
];

```

2. Open Terminal, type:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tolgaerok/nixos.git
cd ./nixos
```

3. Copy either or all files into your /etc/nixos directory:
   - *configuration.nix*
   - *hardware-configuration.nix*  - Change to suit to you `UUID`
   - *bluetooth.service*
   - *smb-secrets*
    
Execute `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` in your terminal afterward.

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```
